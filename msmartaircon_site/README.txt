M Smart Aircon â€” Website
-----------------------

Files included:
- index.html   -> Main website file (blue & white fancy theme)
- README.txt   -> This file
- images/      -> Place your product/shop images here as img1.jpg, img2.jpg, img3.jpg to show in gallery
- CNAME        -> If you later buy msmartaircon.com, put the domain in this file (one line) and add to GitHub repo root

How to publish on GitHub Pages (quick):
1. Create a GitHub account (https://github.com/) if you don't have one.
2. Create a new repository named exactly: msmartaircon.github.io
3. Upload all files from this folder to that repository (index.html at root).
4. Wait a minute, then visit: https://msmartaircon.github.io
5. To use a custom domain (e.g., msmartaircon.com), buy domain, add it to the CNAME file and follow GitHub Pages custom domain settings.

If you want, I can give step-by-step screenshots for any step.
